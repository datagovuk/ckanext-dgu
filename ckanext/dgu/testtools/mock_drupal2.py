    <p>Hi there, I agree with the chaps that you have done a wonderful job releasing all this information. And I also agree that though the format may not be ideal, the various technologies for its dissemination are a good choice. However, I\'d make a tentative suggestion... Now that you have the data readily at hand, you might as well make it a little bit more digestible.</p>
<p>To bring you an example, my company produces mobile VAS solutions for big telcos, and we get immense amount of raw data. My line managers expect me to provide them with intelligible insights that enable them to make informed decisions. So I dig through the pile, slice it and dice it, until it makes sense. I do not draw conclusions, at least not explicitly, nor make decision, only possible suggestions of alternative ways for interpretation.</p>
<p>I think in this case, the public does expect two things. The raw data, so the government can be held accountable. And an informative, easy to undertsand form of what the essence of 44 gigs of this data is. (Yes, I know, I am fully aware that it gives rise to criticism, but let\'s face it, what does not?)</p>

    <p>The file adjustment_table_extract_2009_10.txt contains many broken lines, i.e. some fields contain one or more newline characters. Here is a small Perl script to convert from UTF-16 to UTF-8, repair the breaks and do some filtering:</p>
<p>#!/usr/bin/perl<br />

#  - convert DOS/Windows newlines (CR-LF) to host system\'s newlines<br />
#  - fix broken lines (spurious line breaks in some records)<br />
#  - delete "NULL"s<br />
#<br />
# Examples of usage:<br />
#	coins.pl 82 &lt; infile.txt &gt; outfile.txt<br />
#	zcat infile.gz | coins.pl 82 &gt; outfile.txt<br />
#	7z -so e infile.zip | coins.pl 82 &gt; outfile.txt<br />
#<br />
my $fields = $ARGV[0];  # Number of fields expected (81 in fact table, 82 in adjustment table)<br />
my $part;<br />
binmode(STDIN, \':raw:encoding(UTF-16)\');<br />

    <p>Hi Ian<br />
I\'ve not got any embedded newlines. however, there are a lot of files with embedded @ signs in the data, leading to (I think) 466 lines with broken formatting. Notwithstanding comments on the site, it\'s not simple to identify where these have gone wrong with general regex\'s: 528 lines have the string "@ ", 8295 the string " @", 406 lines have the string " @ ".</p>
<p>I think that the only realistic way to get this fixed is to ask for better exporting mechanism.</p>
<p>I find it ironic that there\'s a big ad for the semantic web on this page as SW depends on accurate data.</p>
<p>I must say that I\'m struggling to understand what the data means, eg there seem to be some very odd records (GDP figures and GDP deflators), reading the notes, I cannot see how the number of records can fall between forecasts, but it does and some of the snapshots look very short.<br />

    <p>The adjustment files were very poorly prepared. We found thousands of errors in both files. We had to adjust our data validation tool and create a version just for these files. Combinations of missing end of lines and poor column delimeters - who ever thought of using \'@\' to seperate columns, when this is also widely used in the descriptions. Obviously the data prepartion must have been done in a hurry and not tested.<br />
Couple of hints - start looking for the following in the rows and replace the \'@\' with a space:<br />
1.   \' @ \'<br />
2.   \'@ xx-\' where xx can be any value from 01 to 31<br />
Tools such as UltraEdit are quite useful but you really need to a data validation application that can be modified on the fly, else these files will not be accurate.<br />

    <p>To all those who are complaining about the size of the files, format, etc, please just have a bit of patience. There are many groups who are working to provide more person-friendly ways of drilling down into this data. It\'s a <em>massive</em> step that it has been released at all - I\'ve been involved in open data for some time, and I didn\'t expect HMT to release COINS data on anything like this timescale. So kudos to them. Everyone else just hang-on a short while until the user-friendly interfaces come along, or better still pitch in with ideas of the capabilities you want. What queries would you want to ask if you had a suitably user-friendly tool?</p>

    <p>The method I gave in my last comment for converting from UTF-16 to UTF-8 doesn\'t work for the large files due to a limitation in iconv.</p>
<p>Instead, you can use a small Perl script. Copy the following four lines into a text editor:</p>
<p>#!/usr/bin/perl<br />
binmode(STDOUT, \':raw:encoding(UTF-8)\');<br />
binmode(STDIN, \':raw:encoding(UTF-16)\');<br />
print while ;</p>
<p>Save the file as "utf16to8.pl" in your home directory. Make the file executable:</p>
<p>chmod +x utf16to8.pl</p>
<p>Now you can convert a text file of any size from UTF-16 to UTF-8 as follows:</p>
<p>~/utf16to8.pl &lt; filename.txt &gt; filename.utf-8.txt</p>
<p>Or, to unzip, convert and remove NULLs all in one go, type:</p>
<p>7z -so e filename.zip | ~/utf16to8.pl | sed -e \'s/@NULL/@/g\' &gt; filename.utf-8.nonull.txt</p>

    <p>The compressed file can be extracted using 7zip. The result is a text file in UTF-16 encoding which can be converted to the more common UTF-8 encoding using iconv. The NULL strings can be removed using sed.</p>
<p>Extract the data:</p>
<p>7z e filename.zip</p>
<p>where "filename.zip" is, for example, fact_table_extract_2009_10.zip.</p>
<p>Convert from UTF-16 to UTF-8:</p>
<p>iconv -f utf-16 -t utf-8 filename.txt &gt; filename.utf-8.txt</p>
<p>Remove NULL strings:</p>
<p>cat filename.utf-8.txt | sed -e \'s/@NULL/@/g\' &gt; filename.utf-8.nonull.txt</p>
<p>Or, more succinctly, you can do the whole job in one go:</p>
<p>7z -so e filename.zip | iconv -f utf-16 -t utf-8 | sed -e \'s/@NULL/@/g\' &gt; filename.utf-8.nonull.txt</p>
<p>On Debian based systems, 7z is part of the p7zip-full package.</p>

    <p>So I\'ve spent a few hours working at the data - first part was going through the process of putting it in UTF8, then re-writing it into a more traditional CSV, importing the whole thing into MySQL and started rationalizing it for things such as Department Codes, Account ID etc, setting table indexes and pulling out DISTINCT sets.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the more processing I do the more stags I hit... SQL info result statements included in the CSV, clusters of non-integer account codes and so forth.</p>
<p>It looks like the Guardian has beat me to the punch in creating a searchable index, but the data format hasn\'t exactly helped - I understand this was rushed but IMO spitting out cleaned-up data with separate CSVs for each department and a list of department codes in an additional CSV would have taken little additional time on the governments end and have helped those of us not on the civil service payroll enormously :)</p>

<p>For people who are just curious as to what it is, pages 11-20 of the guidance pdf have explanations of the column headings which might answer a lot of questions without having to download all the data.</p>
<p>It might be helpful for someone to add to the above datasets a \'representative sample\' file with e.g. a hundred or so lines of data, so people can at least get an idea of what it looks like.<br />

    <p>to all the people who are commenting that the information is being released in a difficult to consume form, this is GOOD. this is what we really need, the RAW data. if it were sliced up into easier to consume packages, or presented in nice webpages, it would just mean the civil service taking us further away from the raw original data in the form it was produced, further from the truth basically.</p>
<p>now that the raw data has been released, hacker types (in the traditional sense) the world over can dig through it and present it in any form they/you want. in the coming weeks months and years you will start to see other websites where you will be able to browse, consume and interpret the data in every form imaginable, from traditional spreadsheet style interfaces to insane hollywood style 3d topographical visualisations. these will be built by citizens, using the raw data finally releaed here by government. this page and these csv files are meant for consumption by these hackers, if they were put into a form easily understandable/consumable by the general public this would completely defeat the point of the exercise.</p>

<p>I\'ve just done it here on my side and been able to reduce the 09-10 file down from the original 4 GB to 1.8GB, 23MB RAR - which is small enough to open in Excel if you\'ve got 6+ GB of RAM installed.</p>

    <p>3. Compress to RAR</p>
<p>Right, you want open and transparent data that\'s compressed using a proprietary algorithm. Isn\'t that defeating the purpose? Not to mention, PPMd and LZMA (as implemented by 7-zip) have generally yielded higher compression ratios than RAR\'s proprietary mess.</p>
<p>Not to mention that any RAR files created would be wholly illegal unless someone paid for WinRAR. No such restriction on 7-zip and it\'s technologies.</p>
<p>From the WinRAR license:</p>
<p>   8. There are no additional license fees, <strong>apart from the cost of purchasing a license</strong>, associated with the creation and distribution of RAR archives, volumes, self-extracting archives or self-extracting volumes. Legally registered owners may use their copies of RAR/WinRAR to produce archives and self-extracting archives and to distribute those archives free of any additional RAR royalties.</p>
<p>In short, you must pay for a license before you can distribute archives. The whole purpose of opening up this dataset is to allow anyone to audit the government\'s spending, with the goal of reducing wasteful spending. Paying for WinRAR when superior and free alternatives exist is just more wasteful spending.</p>

    <p>...it\'s not the number of bytes that\'s important here but the number of records (rows). We all know that we can reduce the number of fields (columns) as many are redundant and others are irrelevant, but 2+ mln records are too many for Xls, also if you have just two fields. I can open the entire 4Gb in Xls but before visualize the content I\'m told not the entire file would be open...</p>

    <p>I unzipped the (non-torrent) version of the 09/10 adjustment table and it wasn\'t CSV but rather 2-sign delimited (think tab-delim with an @ instead of a tab). also the data wasn\'t clean for import to something like Excel as it had some lines of non-table data at the end - just the sort of thing to upset already hard-pushed spreadsheet importers on non-high end rigs.</p>

    <p>COINS contains millions of rows of data; as a consequence the files are large and the data held within the files complex.  Using these download files will require some degree of technical competence and expertise in handling and manipulating large volumes of data.  It is likely that these data will be most easily used by organisations that have the relevant expertise, rather than by individuals. By having access to these data, institutions and experts will be able to process and present them in a way that is more accessible to the general public. In addition, subsets of data from the COINS database will also be made available in more accessible formats by August 2010.</p>

    <p>It seems the out of the box unarchiver on OSX can\'t deal with large files, such as the COINS fact table. It spits out a cpgz file, which if you try to unzip just creates another zip, and so on, and so on.</p>
<p>Thankfully I managed to unzip it using Keka (<a href="http://www.kekaosx.com/en/" title="http://www.kekaosx.com/en/">http://www.kekaosx.com/en/</a>), which is an OSX form of 7zip. This worked without any problems. Just thought I\'d share in case anyone else was having any difficulties.</p>
