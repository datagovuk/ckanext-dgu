The eventual conclusion was to make the Appeal-related fields non-dependent on Status, so hopefully this resolves all major problems.

Hope that helps,

17/07/2014I'm just checking the required schema for this data against the schema of the data we already have published to our open data website (http://www.opendatanottingham.org.uk/dataset.aspx?id=75). I can see that our data has been altered and used in the example file available from your website. While it's good to know that our data is being discovered, I have some reservations about the schema used. My concern is that while it seems to ensure the data is machine readable, and has become less human-readable. In particular in the 'EntertainmentTypeLabel' column the contents of several other fields have been concatenated and now become far less easy for a visual scan through to find premises that might meet a certain criteria.

12/03/2015Number of FOI to be confirmed.

Thanks

Keith
06/03/2015Please note
FOI is an estimate to be confirmed next week.
The data validates with the following errors:
1 unique errors
Field 'ServiceTypeLabel' is not in proper format (9)
1 unique warnings
Field 'CaseURL' must be a valid URI (3189)

I will correct next week. I have anomalised individuals until the DP Act issue is agreed this end.
Many thanks for your assistance (especially Tim)

19/03/2015From email of 23rd Feb from Nick Bryan
I would query the following rejection notes:-

1) - OrganisationURI is invalid, goes to error page - this is the URL we were allocated, has someone amended this URL as our previous submissions have all used this URL and were accepted. I have checked other open datasets for neighbouring authorities and they also come up with an Error 404? Please advise
2) - Data.gov.uk field must be filled in for all Incentive Scheme submissions with a data.gov.uk URL for the specific dataset. Guidance available here: http://data.gov.uk/library/user-guide-editors-and-administrators - we haven't had to fill this out for our previous submissions which have been accepted please advise? Again checked the neighbouring authorities and no ODI data is visible.

Thanks
